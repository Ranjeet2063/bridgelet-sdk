   *
   * ## #457 — this is real signing, and it is cross-verified
   *
   * This was previously commented as "For MVP, we create a dummy signature"
   * above code that was never a dummy, and the signing itself did not work at
   * all: `SweepSignerUtil.sign()` passed a bare 32-byte Ed25519 seed to
   * `crypto.createPrivateKey({format:'der', type:'pkcs8'})`, which throws
   * `ERR_OSSL_ASN1_TOO_LONG` under OpenSSL 3, so it could never return a
   * signature. Both are fixed. The byte-exact output is now pinned by
   * `src/common/crypto/sweep-signer.util.spec.ts` against vectors generated by
   * bridgelet-core's own `tools/sweep-signer`, so a drift in the wire format
   * fails CI rather than shipping.
   *
   * ## Cross-repo state (criterion 2) — verified, not assumed
   *
   * Checked against bridgelet-core @ 2baeb3ee28c513a3b40e385f38cbd6ee9f543401:
   *
   * - `SweepController::verify_sweep_auth` in
   *   `contracts/sweep_controller/src/authorization.rs` is **fully
   *   implemented**: it reads `authorized_signer` from storage, rebuilds the
   *   message with `construct_sweep_message`, and performs a real
   *   `env.crypto().ed25519_verify(...)`, with nonce-based replay protection
   *   via `increment_sweep_nonce`. So the "real check against a fake signer"
   *   half of the coordinated-placeholder risk is closed on the contract side.
   *
   * - `EphemeralAccount::verify_sweep_authorization` in
   *   `contracts/ephemeral_account/src/lib.rs` **remains a stub**: it ignores
   *   its `_signature` argument entirely and only calls
   *   `controller.require_auth()`. That is a *different* function from the one
   *   this SDK path targets, but it does mean the signature is not yet
   *   enforced on the `EphemeralAccount::sweep` entry point. Closing that is a
   *   bridgelet-core change and is deliberately out of scope here.
   *
   * So this SDK side is no longer the weak half: it produces a signature the
   * SweepController will actually accept. The remaining gap is on the
   * `EphemeralAccount` path, and it is not something this repo can close.
