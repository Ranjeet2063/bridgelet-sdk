# Database Schema

The current schema is created entirely through the migrations in `src/database/migrations/`.

## Tables

- `accounts`: stores ephemeral account lifecycle data, including encrypted secret material, funding metadata, expiry timestamps, and optional claim metadata.
- `claims`: stores completed claim records and references `accounts.id` through a cascading foreign key on `accountId`.
- `webhooks`: stores outbound webhook subscriptions.
- `webhook_deliveries`: stores per-delivery webhook attempts, including the subscribed webhook reference (`subscription_id`), event type, payload hash, retry count, last response details, delivery timestamp, and creation timestamp. It references `webhooks.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` and has a composite index on (`subscription_id`, `created_at`).
- `contract_events`: stores indexed Soroban contract events, including event type, contract address, ledger sequence, transaction hash, event payload, and creation timestamp.

## Account Status Enum

`account_status_enum` currently contains these values, in order:

`initializing`, `pending_payment`, `pending_claim`, `claiming`, `partial_sweep`, `claimed`, `expired`, `failed`

### Account Status Lifecycle (issue #639)

> Verified for #700 (duplicate of the already-resolved #639, fixed in PR #774).

> **Enforced in code since #445.** The table below is the single source of

> that writes `status` asserts against it, and it is typed
> `Record<AccountStatus, readonly AccountStatus[]>`, so adding a member to
> `AccountStatus` without deciding its outgoing transitions is a compile

State transitions driven by `AccountsService`, `ClaimRedemptionProvider`,
`PaymentMonitorService`, `PaymentMonitorProvider` and `SchedulerService`:

```
                    INITIALIZING
                    |         |
                    v         v
            PENDING_PAYMENT  FAILED      (creation threw, or
              |    |    |                  stuck past initializingTimeoutMs)
              |    |    +----------------> FAILED   (TooManyPayments /
              |    |                       InvalidAmount from the SSE monitor)
              |    +----------------> PENDING_CLAIM   (payment detected)
              v
        (unclaimed timeout)
              |
          PENDING_CLAIM <---------+
              |                   | rollback
              v                   |
           CLAIMING -------------+   (partial retry, skipContractAuth)
            |   |   |
            |   |   +----> PARTIAL_SWEEP
            |   |
            |   +--------> CLAIMED
            v
      (sweep error)
   rollback to PENDING_CLAIM or PARTIAL_SWEEP

  PARTIAL_SWEEP --retry--> CLAIMING

  CLAIMED, EXPIRED, FAILED are terminal (no outgoing transitions).
  X -> X is never a valid transition.
```

- `INITIALIZING` → `PENDING_PAYMENT`: funding transaction submitted.
- `INITIALIZING` → `FAILED`: `AccountsService.create()`'s `catch`, or
  `SchedulerService.runInitializingCleanup()` once the row is stuck past
  `app.initializingTimeoutMs`.
- `PENDING_PAYMENT` → `PENDING_CLAIM`: payment detected, by either
  `PaymentMonitorService.processPayment()` (poller) or
  `PaymentMonitorProvider.markAccountPendingClaim()` (SSE). Both writes are
  **conditional on the source status**, so they cannot move an account
  backwards and are a no-op once it has advanced.
- `PENDING_PAYMENT` → `EXPIRED` / `PENDING_CLAIM` → `EXPIRED`: scheduler expiry
  job, unclaimed past `expiresAt`.
- `PENDING_PAYMENT` → `FAILED`: `PaymentMonitorProvider` on the non-retryable
  contract errors `TooManyPayments` / `InvalidAmount`.
- `PENDING_CLAIM` / `PARTIAL_SWEEP` → `CLAIMING`: claim redemption acquires the row lock (`ClaimRedemptionProvider.redeemClaim`).
- `CLAIMING` → `CLAIMED`: sweep + Horizon payment both succeed.
- `CLAIMING` → `PARTIAL_SWEEP`: contract authorized but the Horizon payment failed; retried with `skipContractAuth=true`.
- `CLAIMING` → `PENDING_CLAIM` / `PARTIAL_SWEEP` (rollback): an unrecoverable
  sweep error. The account stays retryable; it is **not** promoted to `FAILED`.

#### Corrections to the previous version of this section (#445)

Building the table from the actual writes rather than from the diagram above
surfaced three errors in the earlier text. Recording them because this class of
drift is exactly what the shared validator now prevents:

1. **`CLAIMING` → `FAILED` does not exist.** The previous text described a
   `CLAIMING` → `PENDING_CLAIM` / `PARTIAL_SWEEP` → `FAILED` chain, implying a
   failed sweep ends in `FAILED`. It does not: `redeemClaim()`'s `catch`
   rolls back to `PENDING_CLAIM` (fresh attempt) or `PARTIAL_SWEEP` (retry) and
   rethrows, leaving the account redeemable. `FAILED` is only ever written
   from `INITIALIZING` and `PENDING_PAYMENT`.
2. **`INITIALIZING` → `FAILED` was missing from the diagram**, despite being
   written in two places.
3. **`PENDING_PAYMENT` → `FAILED` was missing from the diagram**, written by
   `PaymentMonitorProvider.markAccountFailed()`.

The old diagram also omitted the two `→ FAILED` edges entirely and drew
`FAILED` as reachable only from `PARTIAL_SWEEP`, which no code path does.

#### What the validator does and does not guarantee

It is a **development-time guard against logic errors**, not a concurrency
control. It runs in one process, in memory, immediately before a write; it
cannot see a concurrent transaction, order two writers, or undo a write. Two
workers can both read `PENDING_CLAIM`, both validate `PENDING_CLAIM →
CLAIMING`, and both write.

What actually makes these writes atomic and monotonic is the **conditional
update** (`update({ id, status: FROM }, { status: TO })`) and the
**`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` row lock** inside the `dataSource.transaction` blocks
in `ClaimRedemptionProvider`. The two mechanisms are complementary. When
adding a status write, assert the transition _and_ decide separately whether
the write needs a conditional update or a row lock to be correct under
concurrency.

Because self-transitions are denied, a call site in a `catch` block must not use
the throwing `assertValidAccountStatusTransition`: it would replace the real
underlying error with a validation error. `AccountsService.create()`'s failure
path and `redeemClaim()`'s rollback both use the non-throwing
`isValidAccountStatusTransition` and log instead.

## Connection Pool Configuration

TypeORM is configured with the following pool settings in both
`src/config/database.config.ts` (NestJS runtime) and
`src/config/typeorm.config.ts` (migration CLI):

| Setting                   | Value | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `min`                     | 2     | Does not eagerly open connections at startup — `pg-pool` only uses `min` as a floor below which idle connections won't be closed once they already exist.                |
| `max`                     | 10    | Caps per-instance connections to leave room for other services sharing the PostgreSQL server. See `docs/deployment.md` for sizing guidance against expected concurrency. |
| `connectionTimeoutMillis` | 3000  | Fail-fast: a caller queued behind a saturated pool gets an error after 3s instead of hanging indefinitely (see `docs/deployment.md`, issue #516).                        |

Settings are passed to the underlying `pg` Pool constructor via the TypeORM `extra` key.

## Pool Health Check

`GET /health` performs a live pool probe: it races a `SELECT 1` against the
`connectionTimeoutMillis` (3 000 ms) timeout and reports one of three states:

| `services.database.healthy` | `services.database.poolExhausted` | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`                      | `false`                           | Normal operation                                                |
| `false`                     | `true`                            | All pool connections are in use — scale up or investigate leaks |
| `false`                     | `false`                           | Database unreachable (network, credentials, etc.)               |

## Database Indexes

### accounts

Every index below is created by a migration, and the `Account` entity mirrors
it with an `@Index` decorator so TypeORM's schema-sync check stays clean. The
"Query served" column names the call site the index exists for: none of these
indexes is declared anywhere near the query that needs it, so before dropping
or renaming one, find that call site first. Because
`scripts/generate-migrations.sh` is the source of truth for the migration
files, a change to an index means a change there too.

| Index name                      | Columns               | Added by  | Query served (call site)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UQ_accounts_publicKey`         | `publicKey` (unique)  | `…000000` | Uniqueness enforced when an account is created. No read path filters on `publicKey` — API lookups are by `id`.                                                                                                                                           |
| `IDX_accounts_publicKey`        | `publicKey`           | `…000000` | Mirrors the entity's `@Index('IDX_accounts_publicKey')` decorator; no query filters on `publicKey`.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `IDX_accounts_status`           | `status`              | `…000000` | `AccountsService.findAll()` status predicate (`GET /accounts?status=…`); also usable as a left-prefix of the two composites below.                                                                                                                       |
| `IDX_accounts_claimTokenHash`   | `claimTokenHash`      | `…000000` | Claim-token redemption: `ClaimRedemptionProvider.redeemClaim()` and `TokenVerificationProvider` (`where: { claimTokenHash, deletedAt: IsNull() }`).                                                                                                      |
| `IDX_accounts_expiresAt`        | `expiresAt`           | `…000000` | Range scans on expiry with no status predicate; the two jobs below always carry a status predicate and use `IDX_accounts_status_expiresAt` instead.                                                                                                      |
| `IDX_accounts_status_expiresAt` | `status`, `expiresAt` | `…006000` | **SchedulerService.runExpiryJob()** — `status IN ('pending_payment','pending_claim') AND expiresAt < NOW()` (TypeORM `LessThan`); **PaymentMonitorService.pollAllAccounts()** — `status = 'pending_payment' AND expiresAt > NOW()` (TypeORM `MoreThan`). |
| `IDX_accounts_status_createdAt` | `status`, `createdAt` | `…006000` | **SchedulerService.runInitializingCleanup()** — `status = 'initializing' AND createdAt < <cutoff>` (TypeORM `LessThan`).                                                                                                                                 |
| `IDX_accounts_createdAt`        | `createdAt`           | `…006000` | No production caller today: audit / time-boxed reporting range scans. Least load-bearing of the high-traffic set.                                                                                                                                        |
| `IDX_accounts_deletedAt`        | `deletedAt`           | `…008000` | Soft-delete predicate (`deletedAt IS NULL`) that TypeORM appends to every `find()` / `findOne()`, including `AccountsService.findOne()`.                                                                                                                 |

`…NNNNNN` abbreviates the migration timestamp prefix; the full names are
`1718100000000-CreateAccountsTable`, `1718100006000-AddHighTrafficIndexes`
and `1718100008000-AddDeletedAtToAccountsTable`.

The three indexes from `1718100006000-AddHighTrafficIndexes` are the ones most
likely to be dropped by mistake: `IDX_accounts_status_expiresAt` serves **two**
pollers in opposite directions (expire-soon rows for the scheduler,
not-yet-expired rows for the payment monitor), and nothing in the migration
file itself references either service. `PaymentMonitorService.pollAllAccounts()`'s
`expiresAt > NOW()` predicate depends on it just as much as the scheduler's
`< NOW()` does. The same mapping is repeated in that migration's header
comment, next to the `CREATE INDEX` statements themselves.

Added by migration `1718100009000`. Before it, the table had only its primary
key on `id`, so every lookup that was not by `id` sequential-scanned an
append-only table (#653).

**These are provisional.** No code queries `contract_events` yet, so the index
set follows the documented access patterns rather than an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` of
real queries. Re-validate once a consumer lands and drop whichever index earns
nothing — an unused index on an insert-heavy table is pure write amplification.
`IDX_contract_events_tx_hash` is the first to drop if ingestion throughput
becomes the constraint, since it serves human lookups rather than a hot path.

No separate single-column index on `contract_address` or `event_type` is needed:
both composites can be used as left-prefix scans for their leading column.

### contract_events retention and partitioning

`contract_events` is append-only and unbounded — nothing deletes from it, so it
grows for as long as the contract emits events. Indexes keep reads fast but do
nothing about size, and a growing table makes both `VACUUM` and index
maintenance progressively more expensive. Plan for this before the table gets
large rather than after:

1. **Retention first.** Decide how far back events must be queryable. If the
   table is a cache of on-chain data, old rows are re-derivable from Horizon or
   the Soroban RPC and do not need to live here forever. A scheduled delete by
   `ledger_sequence` (not `created_at` — ledger sequence is the authoritative
   ordering) is the simplest effective step, and `SchedulerModule` already hosts
   comparable cleanup jobs.
2. **Then partitioning, if retention is not enough.** Declarative range
   partitioning on `ledger_sequence` turns retention into `DROP TABLE` on an old
   partition instead of a bulk `DELETE` plus `VACUUM`, and lets PostgreSQL prune
   whole partitions for ledger-ranged queries. Note the trade: partitioning
   requires the partition key in the primary key, so `id` alone can no longer be
   the PK — that is a breaking migration and is why it is step 2, not step 1.
3. **Archive before either**, if events are needed for audit beyond the
   retention window: copy to object storage keyed by ledger range, then prune.

### Index design notes (EXPLAIN ANALYZE audit)

- The **composite indexes on `accounts`** use `status` as the leading column because it is a low-cardinality enum (7 values) that prunes the candidate set effectively before the timestamp column filters further. PostgreSQL can also use `IDX_accounts_status_expiresAt` and `IDX_accounts_status_createdAt` as left-prefix scans for status-only queries.
- `IDX_accounts_status` (single-column) is retained alongside the composites to support `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`-verified single-predicate queries.
- All indexes use the default B-tree access method, which supports equality, range (`<`, `>`), and `ORDER BY` optimisations.

## Migration Verification

`test/migrations.integration.runner.ts` provisions a fresh embedded PostgreSQL
database and exercises the whole migration set: `up` in order, `down` back to
zero, then `up` again. Run it with:

```bash
npm run test:migrations
```

It is not part of `npm test` (Jest's `rootDir` is `src/`), so it has to be
invoked explicitly. It verifies:

1. All twelve migrations apply **in the pinned filename order** — the order is
   asserted against a fixed list, so a reordering regression fails the run.
   This matters for the three files sharing the `1718100008000` timestamp
   (`AddDeletedAtToAccountsTable`, `AddPartialSweepToAccountStatus`,
   `CreateClaimAuditLogTable`), whose relative order comes from filename
   comparison rather than from the timestamp itself.
2. The `claims.accountId` and `webhook_deliveries.subscription_id` foreign keys
   are enforced (inserts with orphan UUIDs are rejected).
3. The three high-traffic composite/standalone indexes exist after migration
   `1718100006000`.
4. The `contract_events` table exists with the expected columns and accepts
   inserts after migration `1718100007000`.
5. Reverting every migration, newest first, returns the schema to its prior
   state: no application tables left, `account_status_enum` gone, and the
   `migrations` tracking table empty.
6. Re-running `up` after that full revert restores the same state: the pinned
   order repeats, the `account_status_enum` values and high-traffic indexes
   come back identical, and the entity ↔ schema diff is unchanged. This is
   what catches a `down()` that is missing or only partially reverses its
   `up()`.

Note on `schemaInSync` / `schemaUpQueryCount` in the output: these report
TypeORM's entity ↔ schema diff and are informational, not pass/fail. The diff
is already non-empty on a clean tree because of pre-existing drift unrelated
to the migrations in this folder — `accounts.contractId` (column and
`IDX_accounts_contractId`) exists in the entity but in no migration, and
`claim_audit_log`'s entity declares unnamed `@Index()` decorators while
`CreateClaimAuditLogTable` creates explicitly named indexes, so the diff
proposes renaming them.

`npm run migration:revert` remains the one-step-at-a-time path against a real
database (it reverts only the most recently applied migration per call); see
CONTRIBUTING.md → "Verifying `down()`" for when to use which.

## Foreign Key Cascade Behavior

`claims.accountId` references `accounts.id` with `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`
(`FK_claims_accountId`, set in `1718100001000-CreateClaimsTable` and mirrored
in `src/modules/claims/entities/claim.entity.ts`). This is intentional and
does **not** interact with `accounts` soft-delete: `deletedAt` only sets a
flag and never removes the `accounts` row, so soft-deleting an account never
triggers this FK and existing claims remain intact and queryable. `CASCADE`
only fires on an actual (hard) `DELETE` of an `accounts` row, at which point
its claim records are removed with it rather than being orphaned.
